# Term Proposal

Generate structured proposals for new glossary terms discovered through teaching conversations. Every gap in the glossary is an opportunity to grow it.

## Outcome

A validated JSON term proposal ready for review and potential submission to the solanabr/solana-glossary repository. The glossary becomes a living dataset that improves with every conversation.

## Behavior

### When to Trigger

- A developer asks about a concept that doesn't exist in the glossary
- The coverage checker identifies relevant terms missing from the dataset
- The developer explicitly says "this should be in the glossary"
- During ecosystem exploration, a notable protocol/tool has no glossary entry

### Proposal Generation

Generate the term following the exact JSON schema used by existing glossary entries. **Always include i18n translations** — Kuka natively speaks pt/es/en, so translated term names should be generated at proposal time, not as a separate step.

```json
{
  "id": "kebab-case-identifier",
  "term": "Human-Readable Term Name",
  "definition": "50-500 character definition covering what it is, how it works, and why it matters in the Solana context.",
  "category": "one-of-14-valid-categories",
  "aliases": ["Alternative Name", "Abbreviation"],
  "related": ["existing-term-1", "existing-term-2"],
  "i18n": {
    "pt": { "term": "Nome do Termo em Português" },
    "es": { "term": "Nombre del Término en Español" }
  }
}
```

The `i18n` field is strongly recommended. If omitted, the validator will emit a warning and the submit script will skip i18n injection for that term. Definitions stay in English across all locales — only the `term` display name is translated.

### Valid Categories

`ai-ml`, `blockchain-general`, `core-protocol`, `defi`, `dev-tools`, `infrastructure`, `network`, `programming-fundamentals`, `programming-model`, `security`, `solana-ecosystem`, `token-ecosystem`, `web3`, `zk-compression`

### Validation

Run `./scripts/validate-term-proposal.ts` to check:
- Schema compliance (all required fields present)
- `id` is kebab-case and doesn't duplicate an existing term
- `category` is one of the 14 valid categories
- `related` terms exist in the glossary (or are other pending proposals)
- `definition` length is within bounds
- No alias collisions with existing terms
- `i18n` field present with `pt` and `es` translations (warns if missing)

### Storage

Save validated proposals to `{project-root}/.kuka/proposals/{id}.json`. Create the proposals directory if it doesn't exist.

### Local Injection

Proposals can be immediately injected into the developer's local glossary copy so they benefit from the new term right away, without waiting for upstream approval:

```bash
npx tsx ./scripts/submit-proposals.ts --proposals-dir .kuka/proposals --apply
```

This injects each valid proposal into its category JSON file alphabetically and moves processed proposals to `.kuka/proposals/.done/`.

### Batch Submission (PR to upstream)

When the developer wants to contribute proposals back to the community glossary:

```bash
# Dry run first — show plan without modifying files
npx tsx ./scripts/submit-proposals.ts --proposals-dir .kuka/proposals --dry-run

# Apply and open a PR to solanabr/solana-glossary
npx tsx ./scripts/submit-proposals.ts --proposals-dir .kuka/proposals --pr --pr-repo solanabr/solana-glossary
```

The script:
1. Validates all proposals (rejects duplicates, invalid categories, schema violations)
2. Injects valid proposals into the correct category JSON files alphabetically
3. Injects i18n translations into `data/i18n/pt.json` and `data/i18n/es.json` (if `i18n` field present)
4. Moves processed proposals to `.kuka/proposals/.done/`
5. Creates a git branch, commits, and opens a PR via `gh` CLI with a detailed description listing all proposed terms

### Quality Standard

Proposals should match the quality of existing glossary entries: technically precise, concise, Solana-contextualized, and with meaningful cross-references. Kuka drafts them during teaching — the best definitions come from actually explaining the concept to someone.
